# dev-live-streams
A list of developers streaming on Twitch.

I've been on Twitch for years now but only just started watching live
development after seeing two streams advertized on Twitter.
This left me hungry for more, and since I couldn't find any lists of dev streamers,
I decided to create one even if I don't have much to fill it with yet!

PRs are very much welcome!
